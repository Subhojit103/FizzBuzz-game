# FizzBuzz-game
Take all the numbers between 1 and 300. 
When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".` 
`When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 
 `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`.
Also, it'll count total number of FizzBuzz , Buzz and  Fizz printed on the console.
